## Turn every spark into momentum

Cherished ideas often die in the gap between inspiration and action. Spark Memos closes that gap with a capture-first flow: drop text, photos, links, and quotes into one memo, give it a color and icon, and ship it as a clean image the moment you're ready to share.

### Why makers are switching to Spark Memos

- Instant capture: add text, photos, links, and snippets in seconds with zero formatting friction.
- Collections with personality: name a collection, pick an icon, set a color, and keep related sparks together.
- Share-ready by default: turn any memo into a beautiful image or create a new memo straight from another app's share sheet.
- Built for real life: perfect for reading queues, research crumbs, standup notes, or quick journaling.

### A 10-minute adoption plan

1. Create two Collections: `Inbox` for raw sparks and `Projects` for anything tied to an outcome.
2. Add Spark Memos to your phone's share sheet so every article, screenshot, or quote lands in the right Collection.
3. Use short memos: keep each idea to one clear action or thought; add a link or image if it adds context.
4. Close your day with a 2-minute review: promote key memos from `Inbox` to `Projects` and export the one you want to share.

### Real-world plays

- Content teams capture hooks, visuals, and sources in one place before drafting.
- Founders and PMs log meeting actions in Collections per workstream so nothing slips.
- Students and researchers save excerpts with links, then export highlights to share with peers.

### Ship your ideas faster
